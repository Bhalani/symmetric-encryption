## SymmetricEncryption API

### Quick Test

Before configuration or generating keys SymmetricEncryption can be used in a
standalone test scenario:

~~~ruby
# Use test encryption keys
SymmetricEncryption.cipher = SymmetricEncryption::Cipher.new(
  key:         '1234567890ABCDEF',
  iv:          '1234567890ABCDEF',
  cipher_name: 'aes-128-cbc'
)

encrypted = SymmetricEncryption.encrypt('hello world')

puts SymmetricEncryption.decrypt(encrypted)
~~~

### SymmetricEncryption.encrypt

Encrypt the supplied string using Symmetric Encryption.

~~~ruby
SymmetricEncryption.encrypt(str, random_iv: true, compress: false, type: :string)
~~~

- Returns a Base64 encoded string.
- Returns nil if the supplied `str` is nil.
- Returns "" if it is a string and it is empty.

Parameters

- `value` `[Object]`
    - String to be encrypted. If `str` is not a string, #to_s will be called on it
      to convert it to a string.

- `random_iv` `[true|false]`
    - Whether the encrypted value should use a random IV every time the field is encrypted.
    - It is recommended to set this to true where feasible. If the encrypted
      value could be used as part of a SQL where clause, or as part
      of any lookup, then it must be false.
    - Setting random_iv to true will result in a different encrypted output for
      the same input string.
    - Note: Only set to true if the field will never be used as part of
      the where clause in an SQL query.
    - Note: When random_iv is true it will add a 8 byte header, plus the bytes
      to store the random IV in every returned encrypted string, prior to the
      encoding if any.
    - Default: false
    - Highly Recommended where feasible: true

- `compress` `[true|false]`
    - Whether to compress `str` before encryption.
    - Should only be used for large strings since compression overhead and
      the overhead of adding the 'magic' header may exceed any benefits of
      compression.
    - Note: Adds a 6 byte header prior to encoding, only if :random_iv is false
      Default: false

- `type` `[:string|:integer|:float|:decimal|:datetime|:time|:date|:boolean]`
    - Expected data type of the value to encrypt.
    - Uses the coercible gem to coerce non-string values into string values.
    - When type is set to :string (the default), uses #to_s to convert
      non-string values to string values.
    - Note: If type is set to something other than :string, it's expected that
      the coercible gem is available in the path.
    - Default: :string

### SymmetricEncryption.decrypt

Decrypt string previously encrypted with Symmetric Encryption.

~~~ruby
SymmetricEncryption.decrypt(encrypted_and_encoded_string, version=nil, type=:string)
~~~

- Returns decrypted value
   - On decryption an attempt is made to encode the data as UTF-8, if it fails it
     will be returned as BINARY encoded.
- Returns nil if the supplied value is nil.
- Returns "" if it is a string and it is empty.
- Raises OpenSSL::Cipher::CipherError when `str` was not encrypted using
  the primary key and iv.

Parameters:

- `str` `[String]`
    - Encrypted string to decrypt
    
- `version` `[Integer]`
    - Specify which cipher version to use if no header is present on the encrypted string

- `type` `[:string|:integer|:float|:decimal|:datetime|:time|:date|:boolean]`
    - If value is set to something other than `:string`, then the coercible gem
      will be use to coerce the unencrypted string value into the specified
      type. This assumes that the value was stored using the same type.
    - Note: If type is set to something other than `:string`, it's expected
      that the coercible gem is available in the path.
    - Default: :string

If the supplied string has an encryption header then the cipher matching
the version number in the header will be used to decrypt the string.

When no header is present in the encrypted data, a custom Block/Proc can
be supplied to determine which cipher to use to decrypt the data.
see `#cipher_selector=`.
